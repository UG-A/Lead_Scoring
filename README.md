Problem Statement - 

X Education is a leading education company that offers top-notch online courses to industry professionals. Our website attracts a large number of professionals who are keen to enhance their skills and knowledge. We have a streamlined process of form filling on our website, which enables us to identify potential leads quickly and efficiently.

Our sales team is highly skilled and dedicated to converting leads into customers. We use a variety of communication channels, including phone calls and emails, to engage with our leads. While we have a high conversion rate of around 30%, we are always looking for ways to improve our processes and increase our success rate.

To achieve this, we are focused on identifying the most promising leads, also known as Hot Leads. By targeting these leads, we can ensure that our sales team is spending their time and energy on the most valuable prospects. This will not only increase our conversion rate but also improve the overall efficiency of our sales process. At X Education, we are committed to providing the best possible service to our customers and delivering exceptional results.

Business Objective - 

Lead X has tasked us with developing a model that will assign a lead score ranging from 0 to 100 to every lead. This will enable them to easily identify the hottest leads and significantly boost their conversion rate. Our CEO has set an ambitious goal of achieving an 80% lead conversion rate.

Furthermore, we are expected to create a model that can handle future constraints such as peak time actions, optimal utilization of manpower, and post-target achievement approaches. We are confident in our ability to deliver a comprehensive and effective solution that will exceed expectations.
